You are working on the RiseUp website, a youth football organization that empowers underserved communities through sports. Follow these strict branding guidelines for ALL code you generate:

## VISUAL IDENTITY

### Color Palette
- **Primary Background**: #000000 (pure black)
- **Primary Foreground**: #ffffff (pure white)
- **Signature Accent**: #b72031 (patriotic red - THIS IS OUR BRAND COLOR)
- **Muted Background**: #121126 (patriotic blue - THIS IS OUR BRAND COLOR)
- **Muted Text**: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6) (60% white)

CRITICAL: The accent color #b72031 is RiseUp's signature brand color. Use it for:
- Primary CTAs (especially "Donate" buttons)
- Hover states on important elements
- Selection highlights
- Focus rings
- Key visual accents

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter (via next/font)
- **Font Features**: Enable ligatures ("rlig" 1, "calt" 1)
- **Font Smoothing**: Always use antialiasing (-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased)
- **Weights**: Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700)

### Design Principles
1. **Dark-First**: All designs should embrace the black background, not fight it
2. **High Contrast**: Use pure white (#ffffff) for primary text, 60% white for secondary
3. **Modern & Tech-Forward**: Inspired by Anduril's aesthetic - sleek, professional, cutting-edge
4. **Purposeful Accent Use**: The red accent (#b72031) should draw attention to key actions
5. **Clean & Minimal**: Reduce visual noise, let content breathe

### Component Styling

#### Buttons
- **Shape**: Always rounded-full (pill-shaped)
- **Primary**: bg-accent (#b72031), text-white, hover:opacity-90
- **Secondary**: bg-white, text-black, hover:bg-white/90
- **Outline**: border border-white, text-white, hover:bg-white/10
- **Sizes**: sm (px-4 py-2), md (px-6 py-3), lg (px-8 py-4)
- **Focus**: ring-2 ring-accent ring-offset-2 ring-offset-black

#### Cards
- Dark background with subtle borders
- Hover effects should be subtle (slight opacity or border color changes)
- Internal padding: typically p-6 or p-8

#### Links
- Default: text-white/60
- Hover: text-white
- Transition: transition-colors
- No underlines unless in body text

#### Forms
- Dark backgrounds with white/60 borders
- Focus states use accent color
- Labels in white/60, inputs in white
- Placeholder text at 40% opacity

### Spacing Scale
Use Tailwind's default spacing scale:
- Small gaps: 2, 3, 4 (8px, 12px, 16px)
- Medium gaps: 6, 8 (24px, 32px)
- Large gaps: 12, 16, 24 (48px, 64px, 96px)
- Section padding: px-6 (24px) on mobile, up to px-8 on desktop
- Max content width: max-w-7xl (1280px)

### Animation & Transitions
- **Duration**: 200ms for most interactions, 300ms for larger movements
- **Easing**: ease-in-out (default)
- **Smooth Scroll**: Always enabled (scroll-behavior: smooth)
- Keep animations subtle and performant

### Accessibility
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios (our high contrast palette makes this easy)
- Always include focus states with visible accent-colored rings
- Use semantic HTML
- Include proper ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Test keyboard navigation

## BRAND VOICE & TONE

### Voice Characteristics
- **Empowering**: Use action-oriented language ("Rise up", "Get started", "Join us")
- **Professional yet Approachable**: Serious about our mission, warm in our delivery
- **Community-Focused**: "We", "our community", "together"
- **Youth-Centered, Parent-Trusted**: Speak to both audiences appropriately

### Tone Guidelines
- **Warm but Confident**: Encouraging without being preachy
- **Direct & Clear**: No jargon, plain language
- **Celebratory**: Highlight achievement and growth
- **Authentic**: Genuine stories, real impact

### Messaging Examples
✅ DO:
- "Rise up with us"
- "Empowering youth through football"
- "Join our community"
- "Make an impact today"
- "Build skills, build character"

❌ DON'T:
- Overly corporate language
- Excessive sports clichés
- Condescending or patronizing tones
- Vague promises without action

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Always Use Brand Constants
Import from `@/lib/branding` instead of hardcoding values:

```typescript
import { brandColors, spacing, typography } from '@/lib/branding'
```

### Consistent Class Patterns
When writing Tailwind classes:
- Background: `bg-background` (black) or `bg-muted` (patriotic blue #121126)
- Text: `text-foreground` (white) or `text-muted-foreground` (60% white)
- Accent: `bg-accent` or `text-accent` for the signature red (#b72031)

### Component Architecture
- Use 'use client' only when necessary (interactivity, hooks)
- Prefer server components for static content
- Keep components focused and composable
- Export reusable variants (like button styles)

### File Organization
- `/components/ui/` - Base UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)
- `/components/sections/` - Page sections (hero, features, etc.)
- `/components/layout/` - Layout components (header, footer)
- `/lib/` - Utilities, actions, validations

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before completing any component, verify:
- [ ] Uses brand colors from branding.ts or CSS variables

- [ ] Accessible focus states with accent-colored rings
- [ ] Follows spacing scale (no arbitrary values)

## INSPIRATION REFERENCES

Think of brands like:
