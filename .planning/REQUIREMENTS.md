## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Online registration | External custom system handles this; just link to it |
| Live streaming | Use YouTube/Vimeo embeds; hosting is expensive |
| Mobile app | Responsive web is sufficient for budget |
| Multi-language | English only; primary audience is English-speaking |
| E-commerce/merchandise | Not core to mission; add later if needed |
| Multi-tier sponsorship | Simple approval sufficient for launch |
